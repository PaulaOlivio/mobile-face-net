# MobileFaceNet

This is based on my graduation thesis, where I propose the MobileFaceNet, a smaller Convolution Neural Network to perform Facial Recognition. The model was trained based on the technique [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) proposed by Geoffrey Hinton, and as a coarse model it was used the pretrained [FaceNet from David Sandberg](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet), which achieves over 98% of accuracy on the [LFW dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).
